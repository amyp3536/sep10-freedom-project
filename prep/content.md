## Part A: existing technology
* 1st Google Search: "Sonography apps and software used by ultrasound technicians"
  
* 1st website I looked into:https://www.butterflynetwork.com/
  * After I looked at this website, I found other similiar technologies that can help sonographers learn and perform scans digitally.
     
* First app I reviwed was: [Butterfly iQ](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/iq-plus)
  * A portable handheld ultrasound device that can connect to a phone
  * Shows live imagining through the app
  * Affortable
  * Works on iOS and Andriod
  * Easy to take anywhere    
  * [Butterfly iQ][
    
* Second App I reviewed was: [Clarius Mobile Health](https://clarius.com/)
  * Wireless handheld scanner
  * Uses AI to improve image clarity
  * Image shows on phones & tablets
  * Helps users learn
  * Works on iOS and Android
  * [Clarius Mobile Health][]
    
* Third App I reviewed was: [Philips Lumpify](https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/ultrasound)
  * Turns phone and tablet into a ultrasound system
  * Connects with a probe and shows liive images
  * Can be great for practice
  * Works on iOS and Android
    
* Fourth App I reviewed was: [SonoSim](https://sonosim.com/)
  * An Ultrasound siulation Software used to train students
  * Has virtual patience and realistic cases
  * It is used in colleges and medical training programs
  * Works on Windows and Mac

* Fifth App I reviwed was: [GE Health Care](https://www.gehealthcare.com/)
  * Touch screen ultrasound for imaging
  * Has AI tools to help
  * Works with Windows

## Hardware in Diagnostic Medical Sonography
* 1st Google Search:"Hardware used in diagnostic sonographer besides ultrasound machines"
* 1st website I looked into: "https://www.gehealthcare.com/"
  * After I looked at this website, I learned there are many other equipment that help the ultrasound machines work better and make the proccess more comfortable.

* 1st Hardware I reviewed was:[3D/4D Imaging Probes](https://columbusobgyn.com/what-is-the-difference-2d-3d-4d-ultrasounds/)
  * Provides a clearer picture
  * Not taking over 2D scans, but a tool
  * Is expensive
  * Can be found in specialized clinics
  * Can see the Ulrasound in real time
* 2nd Hardware I reviewed was:[Gel Warmer](https://blog.universalmedicalinc.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-ultrasound-gels-and-warmers/#:~:text=The%20Aquasonic%20100%20Ultrasound%20Transmission%20Gel%20is%20available%20in%2020g,ll%20be%20in%20touch%20shortly.)
  * Keeps gel warm for comfort 
  * Better sound conduction
  * Easy to use
  * Maintains safe temperature levels for patient use
  * Are essential tools found in clinics
* 3rd Hardware I reviewed was:[Footswitch](https://www.herga.com/news-media/technical-blog-archive/footswitches-and-hand-controls-in-medical-image-capture-applications)
    * A pedal on the floor that lets sonographers take images hands free
    * Keeps the process more hygienic
    * They dont have to touch the control panel
    * Enhance work flow
    * Allows sonographers to focus on patient care while taking image
* 4th Hardware I reviewed was: [Manual Adjustment Contols](https://mxrimaging.com/Blogs/Six-Ways-to-Improve-Ultrasound-Imaging#:~:text=The%20quickest%20way%20to%20improve,wash%20out%20the%20dark%20areas.)
  *  Improves images
  *  Controls images with settings

# Timeline
####  Context/Overview 
* Songarphy was founded in **1956** by a team of Scotish obstetrian and enginner who cearted a prototype. This marked a revolutionary step in healthcare by creating a safe, real-time imaging, and afforadability.

### Past ---> Present
* **Gel Warmers**
  * Created to have the ability to give comfort by keeping the gel warm and help sound waves travel better.
* **Footswitch**
  * A pedal on the floor that lets sonographers take images hands free, keeps the process more hygienic, and allows sonographers to focus on patient care while taking image.
* **Manual Adjustment Controls**
  * The ability to use manual controls is essential to adjust brightness and to achive the best image quality.
* **3D/4D Imaging Probes**
  * Provides a clearer picture, not taking over 2D scans, but a tool, and can see the Ulrasound in real time.
* **Philips Lumpfy**
  * Turns phones and tablets to a ultasound system, makes it more acessable and mobile
* **Clarius Mobile Health**
  *  Wireless handheld scanner, uses AI to improve image clarity, and image shows on phones & tablets
* **SonoSim**
  * An Ultrasound siulation Software used to train students, and has virtual patience and realistic cases, it is also used in colleges and medical training programs  
## Part B: possible future technology
* 3rd Hollagram 
  * Projects the ultrasound imaging into the air
  * You can view scan from all angels
  * Gives a better understanding to the image
* Using gestures as controls
  * No use of bottons
  * But rather controlled by hand movements
  * More hygenic
* Interpretining the body part/organ
  * when scanning,labels appear
  * This can help identify
