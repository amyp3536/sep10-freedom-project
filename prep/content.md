## Part A: existing technology
* 1st Google Search: "Sonography apps and software used by ultrasound technicians"
  
* 1st website I looked into:https://www.butterflynetwork.com/
  * After I looked at this website, I found other similiar technologies that can help sonographers learn and perform scans digitally.
     
* First app I reviwed was: [Butterfly iQ](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/iq-plus)
  * A portable handheld ultrasound device that can connect to a phone
  * Shows live imagining through the app
  * Affortable
  * Works on iOS and Andriod
  * Easy to take anywhere    
  * [Butterfly iQ][
    
* Second App I reviewed was: [Clarius Mobile Health](https://clarius.com/)
  * Wireless handheld scanner
  * Uses AI to improve image clarity
  * Image shows on phones & tablets
  * Helps users learn
  * Works on iOS and Android
  * [Clarius Mobile Health][]
    
* Third App I reviewed was: [Philips Lumpify](https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/ultrasound)
  * Turns phone and tablet into a ultrasound system
  * Connects with a probe and shows liive images
  * Can be great for practice
  * Works on iOS and Android
    
* Fourth App I reviewed was: [SonoSim](https://sonosim.com/)

## Hardware in Diagnostic Medical Sonography
* 1st Google Search:"Hardware used in diagnostic sonographer besides ultrasound machines"
* 1st website I looked into: "https://www.gehealthcare.com/"
  * After I looked at this website, I learned there are many other equipment that help the ultrasound machines work better and make the proccess more comfortable.

* 1st Hardware I reviewed was:[3D/4D Imaging Probes](https://columbusobgyn.com/what-is-the-difference-2d-3d-4d-ultrasounds/)
  * Provides a clearer picture
  * Not taking over 2D scans, but a tool
  * Is expensive
  * Can be found in specialized clinics
  * Can see the Ulrasound in real time
* 2nd Hardware I reviewed was:[Gel Warmer](https://blog.universalmedicalinc.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-ultrasound-gels-and-warmers/#:~:text=The%20Aquasonic%20100%20Ultrasound%20Transmission%20Gel%20is%20available%20in%2020g,ll%20be%20in%20touch%20shortly.)
  * Keeps gel warm for comfort 
  * Better sound conduction
  * Easy to use
  * Maintains safe temperature levels for patient use
