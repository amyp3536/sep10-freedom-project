## Content
Since my last blog entry, I have been researching the software and hardware technology used in Diagnostic Medical Sonography. When I first started, I began researching general things like "hardware used in diagnostic sonography accessories""hardware used in diagnostic sonography besides ultrasound machines" and "Sonography Apps""Sonography apps and software used by ultrasound technicians" and Google AI gave me a bunch of bullet points. I view each bullet point and picked out the ones I didnt know about. I later researched up each gadget or app one by one. I revised my searches to be more specific like "Butterfly iQ app" and "Clarius Mobile Health" for software. For hardware I searched up "Gel  warmers used in sonography" and "what are 3D 4D probes for diagnostic sonography". This led to finding the actual website or product page. By doing this, it helped me make sure the hardware and software were real and accurate.
