## Content
Since my last blog entry, I have been researching the software and hardware technology used in Diagnostic Medical Sonography. When I first started, I began researching general things like "hardware in diagnostic sonography" and it got me no where. So I revised these general searches to help me get specefic such as  "accessories in sonography""hardware used in diagnostic sonography besides ultrasound machines" and "Sonography Apps""Sonography apps and software used by ultrasound technicians" and Google AI gave me a bunch of bullet points. I view each bullet point and picked out the ones I didnt know about. I later researched up each gadget or app one by one. I revised my searches to be more specific like "Butterfly iQ app" and "Clarius Mobile Health" for software. For hardware I searched up "Gel  warmers used in sonography" and "what are 3D 4D probes for diagnostic sonography". This led to finding the actual website or product page. By doing this, it helped me make sure the hardware and software were real and accurate. 

## Sources
 [The Butterfly iQ app](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/iq-plus) is a portable handheld ultrasound device that can connect to a phone, shows live imagining through the app, it's affortable, the app works on iOS and Andriod, and it's easy to take anywhere.[The Clarius Mobile app](https://clarius.com/) is a wireless handheld scanner, uses AI to improve image clarity, image shows on phones & tablets in the app, helps users learn, and works on iOS and Android. [The Philips Lumpify app](https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/ultrasound) is able to turn phones and tablets into a ultrasound system, connects with a probe and shows live images, can be great for practice, and works on iOS and Android. [The SonoSim app] (https://sonosim.com/) is an Ultrasound simulation software used to train students, has virtual patience and realistic cases, it is used in colleges and medical training programs, and works on Windows and Mac. [The GE Health Care app](https://www.gehealthcare.com/)  is a touch screen ultrasound for imaging,has AI tools to help, and works with Windows. [This article over 3D/4D Imaginging Probes](https://columbusobgyn.com/what-is-the-difference-2d-3d-4d-ultrasounds/) explains it provides a clearer picture, it's not taking over 2D scans but rather a tool,is expensive, can be found in specialized clinics, and can see the Ulrasound in real time. [This article of Gel Warmer's](https://blog.universalmedicalinc.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-ultrasound-gels-and-warmers/#:~:text=The%20Aquasonic%20100%20Ultrasound%20Transmission%20Gel%20is%20available%20in%2020g,ll%20be%20in%20touch%20shortly.) show that it keeps the gel warm for comfort, it helps with better sound conduction, it's easy to use, maintains safe temperature levels for patient use, and are essential tools found in clinics. [This article over Footswitches](https://www.herga.com/news-media/technical-blog-archive/footswitches-and-hand-controls-in-medical-image-capture-applications) show it's a pedal on the floor that lets sonographers take images hands free, keeps the process more hygienic, they dont have to touch the control panel, enhance's work flow, and allows sonographers to focus on patient care while taking image.

 ## EDP
So far in the **engineering design process**, the problem I want to solve is to improve image quality. In this blog, I focused on researching the diffrent hardwares and softwares that sonographers use. This helped me find out the technology that exists and the things that need to improve in this field. 

## Skills
One skill I improved during this blog was **time managment**. I had to balance working on this blog with everything else I do outside of class such as student goverment on tuesdays, gardening club on wednesdays,health club on Thursdays, and Equity club on Fridays, and my own personal life. Since im not able to finish it all in one day, I try to manage my time and stay organized to stay on top of everything.
Another skill I imporved during this blog is **learning how to Google**. At first I searched things very general that werent helping me find specific softwares/hardwares like "Software in Sonography" and it was overwheliming. I soon learned that revising my searches, and using diffrent words to get better information such as "Sonography Apps" and it helped me find better results. I also learned searching each hardware indivdually helped me find accurate and informative results.
