## Content
  Since my last blog entry, I was working on future technologys for my topic **Diagnostic medical sonography**. During this process, I wanted to create ideas that were revolutianary but still realistic enough to exist in the future. How I came up with these ideas, I first started thinking what conflicts sonpgraphers go through like limited visability, or even the accuracy of images and so I created technologys based on that. 

## EDP
  My next stages in my Engineer Design Process is,to create technologies that could improve ultrasound imaging in the future. After reasearching all the software and hardware that already exist it expanded my knowledge to know what technologies we have in present day. I started thinking anout what problems sonographers face such as unclear images, and limited angles. Then I created the possibly tecchnologyies for the fututre such as hologram imaging,
