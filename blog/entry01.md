# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Diagnostic Medical Sonographer)
##### 10/08/25


## Choosing a topic


The topic I decided on for this project is Diagnostic Medical Sonographer, because it's the career I want to pursue in the future. I've always been interested in the medical field. I find it fascinating that sonographers use ultrasound machines that send sound waves to create an image which helps understand what's going on inside the body. I researched and saw the many ["Machines"](https://www.gehealthcare.com/products/ultrasound?srsltid=AfmBOorY7icsRnYG6hmpzw4gCHkM3Lu8zQo8iYVKyGLZiV_x1MqAvmNK) they use. I also researched how technology makes their work accurate. Its uses technology to help people in signinificant ways. A back up topic I considered was a dental hygenist, since it involves healthcare. However, I enjoyed researching and viewing ["The Uses of Tech in Dentistry"](https://www.rdhmag.com/patient-care/article/14287027/using-technology-as-a-basis-for-high-quality-dental-hygiene-care-part-1). Viewing the impact of technology, seeing it used for good and meaningful ways. 


## Engineering Design Process

I am currently in the first stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to define the problem. The problem that I hope to solve with my project is that **ultrasound images arent always clear, which can make it harder to understand, or diagnose the patient accuratley** The next step is to research, find the best ways we can resolve this issue. 


## Skills

Some skills that I've learned from working on this blog are **time managment**,**critical thinking**,**and problem solving**

#### Time Managment
I have various commitments outside of school such as Student Goverment on Tuesdays, Gardening Club on Wednesday, Health Club on Thursdays, and Equity on Friday. After these clubs, I go to tennis practice, because im on the girls tennis team. I also have a workload from diffretn classes. I also have my own personal life to manage. Overall, I manage to be on top of everything, organizing when to get things done right on time.

#### Critical Thinking
This blog has led me to understand how much technology connects to healthcare and finding solutions

#### Problem Solving
This blog has made me think of way to solve these challenges and impacts.
