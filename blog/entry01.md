# Entry 1: Deciding on My Topic (Diagnostic Medical Sonographer)
##### 10/08/25


## Choosing a topic


The topic I decided on for this project is Diagnostic Medical Sonographer, because it's the career I want to pursue in the future. I've always been interested in the medical field. I find it fascinating that sonographers use ultrasound machines that send sound waves to create an image which helps understand what's going on inside the body. I researched and saw the many ["Machines"](https://www.gehealthcare.com/products/ultrasound?srsltid=AfmBOorY7icsRnYG6hmpzw4gCHkM3Lu8zQo8iYVKyGLZiV_x1MqAvmNK) they use. I also researched how technology makes their work accurate. Its uses technology to help people in signinificant ways. A back up topic I considered was a dental hygenist, since it involves healthcare. However, I enjoyed researching and viewing ["The Uses of Tech in Dentistry"](https://www.rdhmag.com/patient-care/article/14287027/using-technology-as-a-basis-for-high-quality-dental-hygiene-care-part-1). Viewing the impact of technology, seeing it used for good and meaningful ways.
